1. dictionary.txt, Game, TNode, HashChain, HashNode, List, Node, Queue, QueueList, SLList, Stack, StackList. java
2. java Game word1 word2 length
3. Some of the comments go along to the cha cha slide by DJ Casper.. just makes sense with the word hops in there
	-Hashchain is also editied a little
4. if you do trusty and stamps it gets there in 11 hops and not 29.. but looking at it, 
it uses all real words and only replacing them by one so not sure about that one.
Also, Olivia helped me a lot with this assignment.
